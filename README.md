# The COVID Trail
A terminal role playing game based on the popular game - The Oregon Trail. Created using Python.

## Description
The year is 2020       

A mysterious illness has spread across the world, and each day the number of infections is growing.

To make matters worse, supply chain issues have left the country with a severe toilet paper shortage. 

Many have chosen to lock themselves away in their homes, only emerging into the light to receive door dash meal deliveries.

But not you... You've heard of a city in the far west called Portland, where the toilet paper flows freely and avocado toast is served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Today, you set out from Atlanta with a team of capable allies with one goal...

To make it to Portland in the next 10 days, braving disease, disaster, and all kinds of danger.
